One of the most important functions of an OS is that it turns on the device. The power options don't stop at that, though. There's
sleep mode which saves any open documents, running programs, or apps to RAM while turning off any unneeded functions. There's also 
Hibernate mode which saves open documents, running programs, or apps to an internal hard drive so that the power can be removed from
The machine safely.
  The next function of your OS is memory management. Memory management your OS optimizes your computers internal memory. During memory management, the OS moves processes between the RAM and a special portion of the hard drive called "virtual memory" to maximize the optimization of your internal memory.
