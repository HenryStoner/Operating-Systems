One of the most important functions of an OS is that it turns on the device. The power options don't stop at that, though. There's
sleep mode which saves any open documents, running programs, or apps to RAM while turning off any unneeded functions. There's also 
Hibernate mode which saves open documents, running programs, or apps to an internal hard drive so that the power can be removed from
The machine safely.
